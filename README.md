* HTML describes how to structure text documents and links on the web. Overtime it was extended with JS and CSS to let you do much more but at it's core it is a text document rendering technology.
* QML was designed to describe how 2D and 3D spacial elements relate and interact with each other. It can still render text but that is not it's focus. QML is much more concerned with creating a user experience rather than presenting textual information.
